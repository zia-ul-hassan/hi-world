A place to keep ideas and resources
I should be learning new skills to keep my brain working effectively. I started with calligraphy, data science, R-programming, and now I am moving to SQL etc.
I need to keep track of what I have learnt. I need to practice a lot and also need to collaborate so as to apply what I have learnt.
